# SpringBoard-Capstone1
First capstone- I will be looking at data from https://www.healthdata.gov/search/type/dataset?query=STI&sort_by=changed&sort_order=DESC
Data sets from Chicago, IL: 15-44 yr old male and female gonorrhea and chlamydia cases reported from 00-14 
Looking at the link between STI rise and clinics available as the clinic sites are also available
